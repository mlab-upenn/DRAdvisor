This is the message that all shootout entrants received
===============================================================================


 4 June, 1993

 Dear "Energy Shootout" Contestant:

 The table below summarizes the results from the 19 entries that
 were submitted (of the 100+ sets of data provided to contestants).
 and that met all entry criteria given in the rules.  In order
 to be considered as official the entry needed to include predictions
 for both data sets (A and B).

 The winners have been selected, as stated in the rules,
 based on the accuracy of all predictions as measured by the
 coefficient of variation statistic CV as defined therein.
 The smaller the value of CV, the better the prediction accuracy.
 The MBE would have been used as a tie-breaker but that proved
 not to be necessary.

 Your relative performance can be found by referring to the ID
 number in the first column of the table.  Your personal ID
 number is contained in the subject line of this message.  Note that
 the ID number has nothing to do with your ranking. It is only
 useful to identify the line in the table that contains the stats
 on your entry.  The numbers in the next to the rightmost column
 of the attached table were used to select the winners.

 At this time I am not releasing the identity of any entrant nor
 an identification of their methodology.  However, I do plan
 to do both, in keeping with the open and scientific spirit of
 this exercise, unless you contact me to the contrary by e-mail
 by June 11 at

 The highest ranking entrants will be invited to make a presentation
 at the "Shootout " session ASHRAE Annual Meeting to be held at
 10:15 - 12:15 am on June 28. The meeting location is

 Radisson Hotel
 1550 Court Place
 Denver, CO  80202
 Phone:  +1.303.893.3333

 Other hotels include the Brown Palace, Comfort Inn (Downtown
 Denver), and Hotel Denver Downtown (formerly a Holiday Inn).
 Of course, anyone who entered the competition is invited to
 attend the meeting to discuss the matter of energy predictions.
 There will be a colloquium session after the formal presentation
 for this purpose. If you plan to attend, please contact me so
 that arrangements can be made.

 Thank you for your efforts to improve the state of the art in
 energy predictions and for producing your work for this public
 forum.

 Jan F. Kreider

 P.S. The "answers" will be available an anonymous ftp at the
 University of Colorado after June 11, 1993.  The file names are
 a_ans.dat and b_ans.dat.  How to access these data is described
 at the end of this message.

         atrain.dat      The training portion of data set A.
         atest.dat       The testing portion of data set A.
         btrain.dat      The training portion of data set B.
         btest.dat       The testing portion of data set B.
         dataform.at     Details of the format of these four data files along
                         with units of all data.
         a_ans.dat       The atest.dat data set with the correct values
                         of the three energy uses appended at the right end
                         of each record.  These energy uses are whole building
                         electric, chilled water and hot water, respectively,
                         from left to right.
         b_ans.dat       The btest.dat data set with the solar flux that
                         was to be predicted appended to the right end of
                         each record.

===============================================================================
This is the message that all shootout winners received
===============================================================================


 4 June, 1993

 Dear "Energy Shootout" Winner:

 As you probably have determined from a companion message
 today, you are one of the winners of the Shootout and are
 hereby invited to make a 15-minute presentation at the
 "Shootout " session of the ASHRAE Annual Meeting to be held at
 10:15 - 12:15 am on June 28. The meeting location is

      Radisson Hotel
      1550 Court Place
      Denver, CO  80202
      Phone:  +1.303.893.3333

 We very much want you to attend the conference and present
 details on how your achieved your excellent results.

 IF YOU PLAN TO ATTEND, PLEASE LET ME KNOW BY JUNE 11 SO THAT
 I CAN ARRANGE FOR A WAIVER OF THE REGISTRATION FEE AND INFORM
 THE MEETING MANAGEMENT.

 Please contact me at: kreider@cc.ensmp.fr

 Your 15-minute presentation should be technical in nature and
 include the following:

         overview of your methodology - flow chart
         any preprocessing of the data that you did
         details of use of your method in the Shootout
         your results - plots for the testing data set similar
           to those that you submitted with your entry for
           the training set
         conclusions

 After all of the formal presentations, there will be a general
 discussion period among the winners and the audience lasting
 for about 30-45 minutes.

 You may also want to present a formal, peer-reviewed paper
 on your results.  We plan to have a session of such papers
 at the ASHRAE annual meeting to be held in Orlando, Florida
 on June 25-29, 1994.  In your entry form you indicated that you
 would be willing to do so and we now formally invite you to
 prepare a paper.  I will need to receive the paper by November
 1, 1993 in order to have the reviews completed by the deadline
 of mid-February, 1994.

 ASHRAE has a relatively rigid policy on what they call
 "commercialism."  What that means, practically, is that your
 name and affiliation cannot appear in your presentation except
 on your first slide or viewgraph. You may not hand out any
 written material during the seminar although you can provide
 anything to anyone by mail or e-mail after the session.  You
 cannot include the names of commercially available products in
 your presentation materials. Finally, you will need to have your
 presentation materials checked for conformance to all of
 this at the speaker's breakfast at 8:00 am on Monday, June 28.
 This policy, although enforced, is not terribly onerous.

 Thank you for your work and Jeff Haberl and I look forward
 meeting you and hearing your presentation in Denver.

 Jan F. Kreider
